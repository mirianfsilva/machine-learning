# Transfer Learning
### Practical II - Machine Learning
(Repo for my Machine Learning college assignment)

- Objectives: 
The goal of this practical is to practice the use of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Transfer Learning. In this practical you will compare three strategies for training CNNs, two of which use Transfer Learning, in an image classification problem. 

- Task:
Train a CNN to classify the images from part A using the Keras API for TensorFlow. 

- Dataset:  CIFAR-101 . This dataset has 60000 images of 32x32 pixels, of which 50000 are for training and 10000 for test. Each image belongs to one of 10 classes, numbered from 0 to 9. The classes are: airplane, automobile, bird, cat, deer, dog, frog,
horse, ship and truck.
