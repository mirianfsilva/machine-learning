# Exoplanet Classification
### Practical I - Machine Learning
(Repo for my Machine Learning college assignment)

- Objectives
The goal of this practical is to practice the concepts studied during the module and to acquire experience in the use of some of the main classification methods, model evaluation and interpretation and presentation of experimental results. To achieve this you will use and compare multiple classification methods based on different principles in a binary classification problem regarding exoplanet candidates.

- Task
Comparing six classification methods: 
    - Naive Bayes
    - Decision Tree
    - k-Nearest Neighbors
    - Support Vector Machines
    - Random Forest
    - Gradient Tree Boosting. 

- Dataset
The methods will be tested on the task of binary classification of exoplanet candidates found by NASAâ€™s Kepler spacecraft[1](https://exoplanetarchive.ipac.caltech.edu/). 

An exoplanet is a planet outside of the solar system (i.e. does not orbit the sun). The spacecraft first identifies possible signs of exoplanets, referred to as Kepler Object of Interest (KOI). Not all KOIs are actual exoplanets however, some are false positives of different natures. The task is then to classify KOIs between confirmed exoplanets and false positives. Each observation corresponds to a KOI and the features are estimates of the physical properties of the (possible) exoplanet (radius, temperature, features of the host star, etc).
